In this assignment, I have modified the tutorial_stateless_lb.py file and named it as tutorial_stateless_lb2.py.

Working:

In this assignment, the objective is to map the requests coming to virtual ip to one of the real servers in such a way that 50% requests map to server1, 25% map to server2, and the rest 25% map to server3. I have done the same thing. I have modified the code in such a way that the above objective is met and load is balanced between the three servers.

To run the program:
 Put the program in the correct directory and run it as you have run the file tutorial_stateless_lb.py and see the output.
