Python notes:

*********************************Topic: modules*************************************

1. A module can be created by writing/defining one or more functions in a separate file. Save this file with extension .py in 
"C:/python27/" directory.
For eg.:

**********calculator.py************
def mul(a,b):
    c = a * b
    print c

def div(a,b):
    c = a / b
    print c

def power(a,b):
    c = a**b
    print c

*************************************
Save this file in "C:/python27/"

2. How to access that module in your program or from the python shell?

**First, we have to import that module using statement: import calculator
**Then, start using the functions defined in the module calculator in the following manner:
  >>calculator.mul(3,5)
  Output: 15
**If you do some modification in calculator.py file, then you have to reload the module by using 
  reload(calculator) statement in the following manner:
  >>reload(calculator)
  Otherwise, everytime the previous copy of the module will be accessed.
  Reimporting a module after modification won't work.
  Eg. suppose you have modified the mul function of calculator.py to :
  
  def mul(a,b):
    c = a * b
    print "product = " + `c`
	
  then reload the module:
  >>reload(calculator)
  >>calculator.mul(3,4)
  Output: product = 12

**We can also give a new name to a function of a module and use it in our program:
  >>multiply = calculator.mul
  >>multiply(3,5)
  15
